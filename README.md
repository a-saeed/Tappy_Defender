# Tappy_Defender
Valerie has been defending the far outposts of humanity since the early '80s. Her brave exploits were originally immortalized in the 1981 arcade classic, Defender. However, after over 30 years on the front line, she is retiring and it is time to begin the journey home. Unfortunately, in a recent skirmish, her ship's engines and navigation systems were severely damaged. Therefore, now she must fly all the way home using only her boost thruster. This means that she must fly her ship by simultaneously thrusting up and forward, kind of bouncing really, while avoiding enemies who try to crash into her. In a recent communication with Earth, Valerie was heard to claim that it was, "Like trying to fly a lame bird."
